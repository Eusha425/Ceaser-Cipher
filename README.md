# Ceaser-Cipher
An algorithm to create a cipher text using the ceaser cipher technique
The current algorithm is unable to solve upper case text as such all the input gets converted to lower case. It uses different functions to carry out the encryption instead of using any built in functions to convert the charactes to ASCII value.
